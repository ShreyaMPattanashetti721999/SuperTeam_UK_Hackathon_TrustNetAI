# Hackathon Encode 2024

Empowering the Solana Blockchain with AI-driven content moderation and fraud detection to create a safer, more trustworthy digital ecosystem.

## Problem Definition
### Manipulation of Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs):
Decentralized exchanges like Mango Market on Solana are designed to provide trustless and transparent trading. However, they can still be vulnerable to manipulation and exploits. In the case of Avraham Eisenberg's manipulation, it appears that he exploited vulnerabilities in the smart contracts or trading mechanisms of Mango Market to acquire and liquidate assets worth $116 million. Such incidents underscore the importance of robust security measures, code audits, and community vigilance in ensuring the integrity of decentralized exchanges.

### Fake Solana Giveaways:
Scammers often exploit the popularity and hype surrounding blockchain platforms like Solana to trick users into participating in fake giveaways or airdrops. These scams typically involve social engineering tactics, such as impersonating prominent figures or projects associated with Solana, and enticing users to send cryptocurrency in exchange for promised rewards. Such scams highlight the importance of user education, skepticism towards unsolicited offers, and verifying the authenticity of information before taking any action.

### Fraudulent Transactions in DeFi:
DeFi platforms, including those built on Solana, are susceptible to various types of fraudulent activities, including rug pulls, fake token offerings, honeypot contracts, and Ponzi schemes. These schemes exploit vulnerabilities in smart contracts, liquidity pools, or token mechanisms to deceive users and siphon funds from unsuspecting investors.

## Methodology
The project utilizes a multi-step process involving data loading, processing, AI model interaction, and indexing via Pinecone, followed by AI analysis for content and transaction security. Here is an overview of the methodology used:

- **Library Installation:** Essential libraries are installed to support AI model functions, data processing, and vector storage.
- **Data Loading:** Data is loaded from a PDF, likely containing Solana whitepapers or relevant blockchain transaction data.
- **Text Splitting:** Loaded data is split into manageable chunks for easier processing.
- **Embeddings Generation:** Each text chunk is processed to create embeddings that capture the semantic meaning of the text, which are essential for similarity searches.
- **Vector Storage with Pinecone:** The generated embeddings are stored using Pinecone, a vector database optimized for similarity search.
- **Similarity Search Setup:** The infrastructure for performing similarity searches on the indexed data is initialized.
- **AI Model Interaction:** Utilizing a pre-trained model, likely a version of GPT (such as a Llama model), the system is set up to process queries and detect patterns indicative of fraudulent activity.
- **Index Creation and Management:** An index is created in Pinecone to manage the embeddings, allowing for efficient retrieval during similarity searches.
- **Model Conversion and Loading:** The AI model is converted to a format suitable for the environment, and loaded for execution.

## Proposed Solution
We'll start by developing an ML model to detect fraudulent transactions. Since labeled data for Solana is unavailable, we'll train the model on the Ethereum-Fraud-Dataset. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) will extract key fraud-related features, which we'll fine-tune using transfer learning on similar Solana data.

Next, we're crafting a chatbot with Large Language Models (LLM) to aid Solana users with transactions and blockchain use. This LLM model will be trained to recognize and warn against potential scams, like Ponzi Schemes, by analyzing text patterns.

Previous models, such as LSTM networks, have been effective in identifying and addressing DeFi fraud. We're exploring advanced techniques like Transformers to enhance detection accuracy for complex fraud patterns.

Ultimately, both models will merge into a single platform, offering real-time assistance to Solana users, effectively combating fraudulent activities.

## Work Done So Far
The initial step has achieved a remarkable accuracy of 98.9%. Key features highly correlated with fraudulent transactions include 'Time_Diff_between_first_and_last_(Mins)', 'Avg_min_between_received_tnx', 'total_transactions_(including_tnx_to_create_contract', 'Received_Tnx', 'Sent_tnx', 'avg_val_sent', and 'Unique_Sent_To_Addresses', among others.

Additionally, progress has been made on developing the LLM chatbot, currently in the midst of testing.

## Work to Be Done
Fine-tune the existing model using transfer learning on Solana's unlabelled transaction dataset. Implement an advanced LLM-based chatbot to detect and advise on sophisticated DeFi fraud, including Rug pull, Fake token offering, Honeypot contract, and Ponzi scheme.

Finally, both models need to be combined in a singular platform.

## Benefits of Our Approach Against Existing Solutions
### Competitor 1: Blockchain Watchdog
Blockchain Watchdog relies on manual reporting mechanisms, which limits its ability to detect fraudulent activities in real-time. Additionally, it lacks incentives for community engagement, hindering the effectiveness of flagging illicit activities.

### Competitor 2: Solsniffer
Solsniffer analyzes previous Solana tokens and estimates whether they are potentially scams or not based on historical data. Hence, it cannot detect for newer addresses.
